```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    //instantiate two new People objects
    Person aliceObj = new Person("Alice", 21);
    Person bobObj = new Person("Bob", 42);

    //call method on Alice (changing her fields)
    aliceObj.haveBirthday();

    //call the method ON Alice, and PASS Bob as a param to it
    aliceObj.sayHello(bobObj);
}
```

A few things to note about this syntax:

1. You declare (announce) that you're defining a class by using the `class` keyword.
2. Java attributes are _declared_ at the top of the class block (but assigned in the constructor).
3. Classes have **constructor** methods that are used to instantiate the attributes.
4. Class methods are declared _inside_ the class declaration (inside the block, indenting one step).
5. Class methods can access (use) the object's attribute variables by referring to them as `this.attributeName`.
6. You **instantiate** objects of the class's type by using the `new` keyword and then calling a method with the name of the class (e.g., `new Person()`). That method _is_ the constructor, so is passed the constructor's parameters.
7. You call methods on objects by using **dot notation** (e.g., `object.methodName()`).
8. Instantiated objects are just variables, and so can be passed into other methods.

### ES6 Class Syntax {-}
Here is how you would create _the exact same class_ in JavaScript using ES6 syntax:

```javascript
//class declaration
class Person {

    //a Constructor method
    //this is called when the class is instantiated (with `new`)
    //and has the job of initializing the attributes
    constructor(newName, newAge) {
        //assign parameters to the attributes
        this.firstName = newName;
        this.age = newAge;
    }

    //return this Person's name
    getName() {
        return this.firstName; //return own attribute
    }

    //grow a year
    haveBirthday() {
        this.age++; //increase this person's age (accessing own attribute)
    }

    //a method that takes in a Person type as a parameter
    sayHello(otherPerson) {
        //call method on parameter object for printing
        console.log("Hello, " + otherPerson.getName());

        //access own attribute for printing
        console.log("I am " + this.age +  " years old");
    }
}
```

And here is how you would use this class:

```javascript
//instantiate two new People objects
let aliceObj = new Person("Alice", 21);
let bobObj = new Person("Bob", 42);

//call method on Alice (changing her attributes)
aliceObj.haveBirthday();

//call the method ON Alice, and PASS Bob as a param to it
aliceObj.sayHello(bobObj);
```

As you can see, this syntax is _very, **very**_ similar to Java! Just like with JavaScript functions, most of the changes have involved getting rid of type declarations. In fact, you can write a class in Java and then just delete a few words to make it an ES6 class.

Things to notice:

1. _Just like in Java_, JavaScript classes are declared using the `class` keyword (this is what was introduced in ES6).

    <p class="alert">Always name classes in PascalCase (starting with an Upper case letter)!</p>

2. JavaScript classes **do not** declare attributes ahead of time (at the top of the class). Unlike Java, JavaScript variables always "exist", they're just `undefined` until assigned, so you don't need to explicitly declare them.

    - In JavaScript, nothing is private; you effectively have `public` access to all attributes and functions.
3. JavaScript classes always have only one **constructor** (if any), and the function is simply called `constructor()`.

    - That's even clearer than Java, where you only know it's a constructor because it lacks a return type.
4. _Just like in Java_, JavaScript class methods are declared _inside_ the class declaration (inside the block, indenting one step).

    But note that you don't need to use the word `function` to indicate that a method is a function; just provide the name & parameters. This is because the only things _in_ the class are functions, so declaring it as such would be redundant.

5. _Just like in Java_, JavaScript class methods can access (use) the object's attribute variables by referring to them as `this.attributeName`.
6. _Just like in Java_, you **instantiate** objects of the class's type by using the `new` keyword and then calling a method with the name of the class (e.g., `new Person()`). That method _is_ the `constructor()`, so is passed the constructor's parameters.
7. _Just like in Java_, you call methods on objects by using **dot notation** (e.g., `object.methodName()`).
8. _Just like in Java_, instantiated objects are just variables, and so can be passed into other methods.

So really, it's just like Java&mdash;except that for the differences in how you declare functions and the fact that we use the word `constructor` to name the constructor methods.

The other difference is that while in Java we usually define each class inside it's own file, in JavaScript you often create multiple classes in a single file, at the same global "level" as you declared other, non-class functions:

```javascript
//script.js
'use strict';

//declare a class
class Dog {
    bark() { /*...*/ }
}

//declare another class
class Cat {
    meow() { /*...*/ }
}

//declare a (non-class) function
function petAnimal(animal) { /*...*/ }

//at the "main" level, instantiate the classes and call the functions
let fido = new Dog();
petAnimal(fido); //pass this Dog object to the function
```

<p class="alert alert-warning">Although the above syntax looks like Java, it's important to remember that JavaScript class instances are still _just normal Objects like any other_. For example, you can add new properties and functions to that object, or overwrite the value of any property. Although it looks like a Java class, it doesn't really behave like one.</p>

### Inheritance {-}
The ES6 `class` syntax also allows you to specify **class inheritance**, by which one class can `extend` another. Inheritance allows you to specify that one class is a _more specialized version_ of another: that is, a version of that class with "extra abilities" (such as additional methods).

As in Java, you use the `extends` keyword to indicate that one class should **inherit** from another:

```js
//The "parent/super" class
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
  }

  sit() {
      console.log('The dog '+this.name+' sits. Good boy.');
  }

  bark() {
      console.log('"Woof!"');
  }
}

//The "child/sub" class (inherits abilities from Dog)
class Husky extends Dog {
    constructor(name, distance) {
        super(name); //call parent constructor
        this.distance = distance;
    }

    //a new method ("special ability")
    throwFootball() {
        console.log('Husky '+this.name+' throws '+this.dist+' yards');
    }

    //override (replace) parent's method
    bark() {
      super.bark(); //call parent method
      console.log("(Go huskies!)");
    }
}

//usage
let dog = new Husky("Harry", 60); //make a Husky
dog.sit(); //call inherited method
dog.throwFootball(); //call own method
dog.bark(); //call own (overridden) method
```

In this case, the class `Husky` is a _specialized version_ of the class `Dog`: it ___is a___ `Dog` that has a few special abilities (e.g., it can throw a football). We refer to the base, less specialized class (`Dog`) as the **parent** or **super class**, and the derived, more specialized class (`Husky`) as the **child** or **sub-class**.

The sub-class `Husky` class **inherits** the methods defined in its parent: even though the `Husky` class didn't define a `sit()` method, it still has that method define because the _parent_ has that method defined! By extending an existing class, you get can get a lot of methods for free!

The `Husky` class is also able to **override** its parents methods, defining it's own specialized version (e.g., `bark()`). This is useful for adding customization, or for providing specific implementations of callbacks that may be utilized by a framework&mdash;a pattern that you'll see in React.

<p class="alert alert-info">Note that despite this discussion, _JavaScript is not actually an object-oriented language_. JavaScript instead uses a [prototype system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes) for defining types of Objects, which allows what is called [prototypical inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance). The ES6 `class` keyword doesn't change that: instead, it is simply a "shortcut syntax" for specifying Object prototypes in the same way that has been supported since the first version of JavaScript. The `class` keyword makes it easy to define something that looks and acts like an OOP class, but JavaScript isn't object-oriented! See [this (detailed) explanation](http://aaditmshah.github.io/why-prototypal-inheritance-matters/) for further discussion.</p>


## Arrow Functions
As described in [Chapter 11](#functional-programming), JavaScript lets you define functions as _anonymous values_:

```js
let sayHello = function(name) {
  return 'Hello '+name;
}
```

As you have seen, the use of anonymous functions is incredibly common in JavaScript, particularly when used as anonymous callbacks. Because this is so common, ES6 introduced a simpler, more concise _shortcut syntax_ for quickly specifying anonymous functions. Though officially called [lambda functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function), they are more commonly known as [**arrow functions**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), because of how they utilize an "arrow" symbol **`=>`**:

```js
let sayHello = (name) => {
    return 'Hello '+name;
}
```

To turn an anonymous function into an _arrow function_, you just remove the `function` keyword from the definition, and place an arrow `=>` between the parameter list and the block (indicating that the parameter list "goes to" the following block). This saves you a couple of characters when typing.

And for simple callback functions, you can make this even _more_ compact:

<div class="list-condensed">
1. If the function takes only a single parameter, you can leave off the `()` around the parameter list.
2. If the function body has only a single statement, you can leave the `{}` off the block.
3. If the function body has only a single statement _AND_ that statement returns a value, you can leave off the `return` keyword (the "single statement" arrow function returns the result of the last statement, which will either be an expression or `undefined`).
</div>

Thus the above `sayHello` method could be written using **concise body** format as:

```js
let sayHello = name => 'Hello '+name;
```

- I recommend you always leave the parentheses `()` on the parameter list, as it helps with readability (and makes it easier to adjust the parameters later)!

Note that if a function takes no parameters, you **must** include the `()` to indicate it is an arrow function:

```js
//normal function syntax
let printHello = function() {
    console.log('Hello world');
}

//arrow syntax
let printHello = () => {
    console.log('Hello world');
}

//concise body
let printHello = () => console.log('Hello world');
```

- Despite the above example, it's better style to include the `{}` around a function body that doesn't return a value.

Arrow functions are particularly useful for specifying _anonymous callback functions_:

```js
let array = [1,2,3]; //an array to work with

//normal function
array.map(function(num) {
  return num*2; //multiply each item by 2
});

//arrow syntax
array.map(num => {
  return num*2; //multiply each item by 2
});

//concise body
array.map(num => num*2);
```

<p class="alert alert-info">Arrow functions are great and you should always use them for anonymous callback functions (if your target platform suppo
 them). They have quickly become the standard way of writing JavaScript, and thus you will see them all over examples and professionally written code.</p>

### Working with <code>this</code> {-}

In JavaScript, functions are called on **Objects** by using _dot notation_ (e.g., `myObject.myFunction()`). Inside a function, you can refer to the Object that the function was called on by using the **`this`** keyword. `this` is a local variable that is _implicitly assigned_ the Object as a value.

```js
let doggy = {
  name: "Fido",
  bark: function() {
      console.log(this.name, "woofs"); //`this` is object the function was called on
  }
}

doggy.bark(); //=> "Fido woofs"
```

- Here the `this` is assigned the object `doggy`, what `.bark()` was called on.

But because functions are values and so can be assigned to multiple variables (given multiple labels), the object that a function is called on may not necessarily be the object that it was first assigned to as a property. `this` refers to object the function is called on at execution time, not at the time of definition:

```js
//An object representing a Dog
let doggy = {
  name: "Fido",
  bark: function() { console.log(this.name + " woofs"); }
}

// An object representing another Dog
let doggo = {
  name: "Spot",
  bark: function() { console.log(this.name + " yips")}
}

//This is Fido barking
doggy.bark( /*this = doggy*/ ); //=> "Fido woofs"

//This is Spot barking
doggo.bark( /*this = doggo*/ ); //=> "Spot yips"

//This is Fido using Spot's bark!
doggy.bark = doggo.bark; //assign the function value to `doggy`
doggy.bark( /*this = doggy*/) //=> "Fido yips"
```

- Notice how the `this` variable is implicitly assigned a value of whatever object it was called on&mdash;even the function is assigned to a new object later!

But because the `this` variable refers to the object the function is called on, problems can arise for _anonymous callback functions_ that are not called on any object in particular:

```js
class Person {
   constructor(name){ this.name = name; } //basic constructor

   //greet each person in the given array
   greetAll(peopleArray) {
      //loop through each Person using a callback
      peopleArray.forEach(function(person) {
         console.log("Hi"+person.name+", I'm "+this.name);
      });
   }
}
```

In this example, the `greetAll()` function will produce an error: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined`. That is because the `this` is being called from within an anonymous callback function (the `function(person){...}`)&mdash;and that callback isn't being called on any particular object (notice the lack of dot notation). Since the anonymous callback isn't being executed on an object, `this` is assigned a value of `undefined` (and you can't access `undefined.name`).

The solution to this problem is to use _arrow functions_. An arrow function has the special feature that it shares the same lexical `this` as its surrounded code: that is, the `this` will not be reassigned to a (non-existent) object when used within an arrow function:

```js
class Person {
   constructor(name){ this.name = name; }

   greetAll(peopleArray) {
      peopleArray.forEach((person) => { //arrow function (subtle difference)
         console.log("Hi"+person.name+", I'm "+this.name); //works correctly!
      });
   }
}
```

This property makes arrow functions invaluable when specifying callback functions, particularly once classes and objects are involved. _Always use arrow functions for anonymous callbacks!_

<div class="alert alert-info">Alternatively, it is possible to "permanently" associate a particular `this` value with a function, no matter what object that function is called on. This is called **binding** the `this`, and is done by calling the [`.bind()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) method on the function and passing in the value you want to be assigned to `this`. The `.bind()` method will return a _new function_ that has the value bound to it; often you will then take this new function and "re-assign" it to the old function variable:

```js
//re-assign function
myFunction = myFunction.bind(thisValue);
```

This is a common pattern in React (and has some minuscule performance benefits), but for this class you should stick with arrow functions for cleanliness and readability.</div>

<p class="alert">Arrow functions are not optional. **Always use arrow functions for anonymous callbacks!**</p>

## Destructuring and Spreading {#destructuring}
ES6 also introduced [**destructing assignments**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), which allow you to assign each element of an array (or each property of an object) into separate variables all in a single operation. This is called "destructuring" because you are "unpacking" the values of an array into a bunch of different variables.

To destructure an array in JavaScript, you write the variables you wish to assign values to inside of square brackets **`[]`** on the _left-hand side_ of the assignment&mdash;almost like you are assigning to an array!

```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let [x, y, z] = myArray; //assign myArray elements to `x`, `y`, `z` respectively
console.log(x); //=> 1;
console.log(y); //=> 2;
console.log(z); //=> 3;
```

It is also possible to destructure _objects_ using a similar syntax:

```js
let myObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
let {a, b, c} = myObject;
console.log(a); //=> 1
console.log(b); //=> 2;
console.log(c); //=> 3;
```

Note that when destructuring an object, the variables specified on the left side of the assignment are assigned the value from the matching _property_ in the object. Thus in `let {a, b, c} = myObject`, the `a` is assigned `myObject.a`, the `b` is assigned `myObject.b`, etc. The order of the elements on eitehr side of the equation doesn't matter. Any values on the left-hand side that don't have a corresponding property in the object being destructured will not be assigned a value (will remain `undefined`). There is syntax to assign values to different variable names as well, see [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring) for details.

When destructuring, if the array or object contains more than the target number of elements, the extra elements will be ignored. However, you can capture them by using the [**spread operator**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) (**`...`**), which is used to either gather or spread a sequence of values (e.g., a list of parameters) into or across an array:

```js
let dimensions = [10, 20, 30, 40];
let [width, height, ...rest] = dimensions
console.log(width);  //=> 10
console.log(height); //=> 20
console.log(rest);   //=> [30, 40]; the rest of the values!
```

The _spread operator_ is also commonly used to specify that a function can take an undefined number of arguments, and to gather all of these values into a single array:

```js
//a function that logs out all of the parameters
function printArgs(...args){
    //all the parameters will be grouped into a single array `args`
    args.forEach((arg) => {
        console.log(arg) //can log out all of them, no matter how many!
    });
}

printArgs('a', 'b', 'c'); //=> "a" "b" "c"
printArgs(1,2,3,4,5,6); //=> "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"

//a function that adds up all the arguments (no matter how many!)
function sum(...numbers) {
    //numbers is an array, so we can `reduce()` it!
    let total = numbers.reduce((runningTotal, num) => {
        return runningTotal + num; //new total
    }, 0); //start at 0

    return total;

    //or as one line with a concise arrow function:
    return numbers.reduce((total, n) => total+n);
}

sum(3 ,4, 3); // => 10
sum(10, 20, 30, 40); // => 100
```

## Modules
So far, you've mostly be writing all of your JavaScript code in a single script (e.g., `index.js`), even if you'd included some other libraries via additional `<script>` tags. But as applications get larger and more complex, this single script file can quickly become unwieldy with hundreds or thousands of lines of code implementing dozens of features. Such large files become difficult to read and debug ("where _was_ that function defied?"), can introduce problems with the shared global namespace ("did I already declare a `user` variable?"), and overall mixes code in a way that violates the _Separation of Concerns_ principle.

The solution to this problem is to split up your application's code into separate **modules** (scripts), each of which is responsible for a separate piece of functionality. And rather than loading each module through a separate `<script>` tag (potentially leading to ordering and dependency issues while continuing to pollute the global namespace), you can define each module as a self-contained script that explicitly "imports" (loads) the functions and variables it needs from other modules. This allows you to better organize your program as it gets large.

While separating code into modules is a common in the Node.js environment, ES6 adds syntax that allows you to treat individual `.js` files as modules that can communicate with one another. These are known as [**ES6 Modules**](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_basics-of-es6-modules).

In order to use modules inside of the browser, you'll need to specify the `type="module"` attribute for your `<script>` tag (and loading the page via a web server):

```html
<!-- load a script that can include other modules -->
<script type="module" src="path/to/script.js"></script>
```

However, most commonly you will _not_ use modules directly inside of the browser. Instead you will load them through an external build tool like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). In these situations, you'll be using the _module loader_ provided by the Node JavaScript runtime. This loader does introduce some quirks in syntax, which are noted in the syntax explanation.

### Module Syntax {-}
As in Java, ES6 Modules are able to "load" external modules or libraries by using the **`import`** keyword:

```java
//Java example: import `Random` variable from `java.util` to use globally
import java.util.Random
```

```js
//JavaScript: import the `Random` variable from a `util.js` module
import { Random } from './util';
```

This is most common version of the ES6 `import` syntax: you write the keyword `import`, following by a set of braces `{ }` containing a comma-separated sequence of variables you wish to "import" from a particular module. This is followed by the `from` keyword, followed by a string containing the **relative path** to the module script to import. Note that in Node-based systems (such as the React build environment) including the extension of the module script is optional (by default, the module loader will look for files ending in `.js`).

- Be sure to include the `./` to indicate that you're loading a file from a particular directory. If you leave that off, the Node module loader will look for a module installed on the _load path_ (e.g., in `node_modules/`). That is how you load external files such as jQuery though:

    ```js
    //with jquery installed in `node_modules/`
    //import the `$` and `jQuery` variables
    import {$, jQuery} from 'jquery';
    ```

If you want to make a variable available from one module to use in another, you will need to **export** it (so that it can be "imported" elsewhere). You do this by using the **`export`** keyword, placed in front of the variable declaration:

```js
/*** my-module.js ***/
export let question = "Why'd the chicken cross the road?";
export let answer = "To get to the other side";
export function laugh() {
    console.log("hahaha");
}
```

This is called a **named export** (in contrast to a _default export_ described below).

```js
/*** index.js ***/
import { question, answer, laugh } from './my-module';

console.log(question); //=> "Why'd the chicken cross the road?"
console.log(answer); //=> "To get to the other side"
laugh(); //"hahaha"
```

- Note that you can export functions as well as variables, since functions _are_ values!
- Once a value has been imported, it is available globally (just as if it were defined in a previous `<script>` tag)

There are a number of ways to export and import variables, giving you significant customization on which values you wish to share and load:

```js
/*** my-module.js ***/
export function foo() { return 'foo'; } //make available (as above)

function bar() { return 'bar'; }
export bar; //export previously defined variable

export { bar as barFunction }; //provide an "alias" (consumer name) for value

//will not be available (a "private" function)
function baz() { return 'baz'; }
```

```js
/*** index.js ***/
import {foo, barFunction} from './my-module'; //import multiple values
foo() //=> 'foo'
barFunction() //=> 'bar'

import {foo as myFoo} from './my-module'; //provide an "alias" for value
myFoo(); //=> 'foo'

import * as theModule from './my-module'; //import everything that was exported
                                          //loads as a single object with values
                                          //as properties
theModule.foo(); //=> 'foo'
theModule.barFunction(); //=> 'bar'
theModule.baz(); //Error [private function]
```

Note the additional syntax options in this example:

- You can use the **`as`** keyword to "alias" a variable either when it is exported (so it is shared with a different name) or when it is imported (so it is loaded and assigned a different name). This is particularly useful when trying to produce a clean API for a module (so you `export` values with consistent names, even if you don't use those internally), or when you want to `import` a variable with a very long name.

- It is possible to just `import` _everything_ that was exported by a module using the **`import * as`** syntax. You specify an object name that will represent the values exported module (e.g., `theModule` in the example), and each exported variable will be a _property_ of that object. This is particularly useful when you may be adding extra `exports` to a module during development, but don't want to keep adjusting the `import` statement.

- Note also that _only_ the variables you `export` are made available to other modules! This allows you to make variables and functions that are "private" to a module!

    <!-- ```js
    /*** my-module.js ***/
    let secretPassword = 12345;

    export function checkPassword(password) {
        return password == secretPassword; //check if they are the same
    }
    ```

    ```js
    /*** index.js ***/
    import * as module from './my-module';

    console.log(module.secretPassword); //undefined, variable was not exported

    module.checkPassword('password'); //false, passwords don't match
    ``` -->

Finally, each module can also `export` a _single_ (just one!) **default** variable, which provides a slight shortcut when importing the variable from that module. You specify the _default export_ by including the **`default`** keyword immediately after `export`:

```js
/*** my-module.js ***/
//this function is the "default" export
export default function sayHello() {
    return 'Hello world!';
}
```

```js
/*** index.js ***/
import greet from './my-module'; //import the default value

greet(); //=> "Hello world!"
```

- When importing a `default` export, you just provide the variable name ("alias") you wish to refer to that exported value by.
- Note that it is also possible to make anonymous values into `default` exports:

    ```js
    /*** animals.js ***/
    export default ['lion', 'tiger', 'bear']; //export anonymous array
    ```

The `default` export technique is particularly common in object-oriented frameworks like React, where you can make each JavaScript module contain the code for a single function or `class`. That single `class` can be made the `default` export, allowing other modules to import it quickly and easily as `import MyComponent from './MyComponent.js'`.


<div class="alert alert-info">This section describes ES6 modules, which are used with web applications (being part of the ECMAScript specification). However, Node.js by default uses an alternate module loading system called [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_modules). This uses the built-in method `require()` to load a module (which returns a single "exported" variable as a result). Values are exported from a module by assigning them to the `module.exports` global. This course will exclusively utilize ES6 Modules, but it's good to be aware of the alternate CommonJS approach when searching for help.</p>

There are a few other notable syntax options provided by ES6 that you will likely come across.

### Template Strings {-}
In ES6, you can declare Strings that contain embedded expressions, allowing you to "inject" an expression directly into a string (rather than needing to concatenate the String with that expression). These are known as [**template strings**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) (or _template literals_). Template strings are written in back ticks (**``` `` ```**) rather than quotes, with the injected expressions written inside of a **`${}`** token:

```js
let name = 'world';
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; //template string
console.log(greeting); //=> "Hello, world!"
```

- Template strings can also include line breaks, allowing you to make multi-line strings!

Note that you can put _any_ expression inside the `${}` token; however, it's best practice to keep the expression as simple as possible (such as by using a local variable) to support readability:

```js
let name = 'world';

//greeting with capitalization. Don't do this!
let greeting = `Hello, ${name.substr(0,1).toUpperCase() + name.substr(1)}!`
console.log(greeting); //=> "Hello, world!";

//do this instead!
let capitalizedName = name.substr(0,1).toUpperCase() + name.substr(1);
let greeting = `Hello, ${capitalizedName}`
console.log(greeting); //=> "Hello, world!";
```

<!-- One more example:

```js
//provide a name, an animal, and a verb
function excuse(name, animal, verb) {
  let email = `Hello Professor ${name},

Please excuse my missing assignment,
as my ${animal} ate it.

${verb} you later,
A Student`;

  console.log(email);
}

excuse('Joel', 'Lemur', 'Smell');
``` -->


These are a few of the more common and potentially useful ES6 features. However, remember that most of these are just "syntactic shortcuts" for behaviors and functionality you can already achieve using ES5-style JavaScript. Thus you don't need to utilize these features in your code (though they can be helpful), and they will often show up in how we utilize libraries such as React.
